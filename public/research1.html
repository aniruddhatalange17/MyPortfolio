            Introduction
            <br>
            <br>
            Branching Design:
            <br><br>
• Developed bio-inspired branching algorithms for improved fluid
flow and thermal performance in engineering applications.
<br>
• Studied biological laws governing branching structures, including
Murray's Law, Horton's Law, and Leonardo's Law.
<br>
<br>
Simulation:
<br>
• Conducted mesh refinement studies to optimize simulation
accuracy and efficiency.
<br>
• Compared results from ANSYS Fluent with Flownex software for
validation.
<br>
<br>

Additive Manufacturing:
<br>
• Experimented with Polyjet and Selective Laser Sintering 3D
printing for creating branching channels.
<br>
• Printed symmetric and organic designs with varying channel
diameters.
<br>
<br>
Experimental validation:
<br>
• Created a flow visualization setup to observe fluid behavior in
branching channels.
<br>
• Planned experiments to compare flow rate predictions with
simulation results.
<br>
<br>

Simulation Methodology
<br>
Utilized Rhino and Grasshopper software to create initial 3D
• Tackled the challenge of non-uniform flow distribution in a multi-
geometry.
<br>
• Performed necessary cleanup operations in SpaceClaim to ensure
model integrity.
<br>
• Applied inflation layers over the outlets to accurately capture fluid
behavior.
<br>
• Converted to Fluent meshing and Implemented hexagonal
tetrahedral meshing for improved accuracy.
<br>
• Generated contour plots for comprehensive flow visualization.
<br>
• Created volume flow rendering plots to identify key result areas.
<br>
• Studied mass flow rate averages across outlets.
<br>
• Analyzed pressure results throughout the system.
<br>
<br>
Simulation Methodology
<br>
<br>
Results:
<br>
Tackled the challenge of non-uniform flow distribution in a multi-
geometry.
<br>
Mastered meshing techniques to ensure accurate CFD simulation
results, particularly at the model outlets.
<br>
• Successfully achieved uniform mass flow rate across all outlets,
demonstrating significant improvement from the initial centralized
flow pattern.
<br>
• Developed an innovative flow visualization system that automates
meshing and generates Excel-based reports for various designs.
<br>
• Streamlined design optimization process by efficiently analyzing
mesh quality and predicting uniform flow, reducing analysis time by
approximately 25%.
